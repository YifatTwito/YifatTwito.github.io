<h1 style="text-align:center; color:blue">About Tigers</h1>
<p style= color:darkviolet>
Tiger are the largest species among the Felidae and classified in the genus Panthera.<br>
It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside.<br>
It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. <br>
It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat,<br>
Which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother<br>
For about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.<br>
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center; color:blue"> Habitat</h2>
<p style= color:darkviolet>
The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin,<br>
And in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda islands. Since the early 20th century,<br>
Tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated in Western and Central Asia,<br>
From the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China.<br> 
Today's tiger range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests<br>
On the Indian subcontinent and Sumatra. The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 1986.<br>
As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, <br>
Down from around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century, with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets <br>
Isolated from each other. Major reasons for population decline include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching.<br> 
This, coupled with the fact that it lives in some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.<br>
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center; color:blue">Interesting facts</h2>
<p style= color:darkviolet>
The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It featured prominently in ancient mythology and folklore<br>
And continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams.<br>
The tiger is the national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.
