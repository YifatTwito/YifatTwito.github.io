<h1 style="text-align:center; color:blue">About Horses</h1>
<p style= color:darkviolet> 
The horse is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae.<br>
The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal<br>
Of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC.<br>
Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. <br>
These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, <br>
Such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, <br>
Specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, <br>
Breeds, locomotion, and behavior.<br>

Horses' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed sense of balance<br>
And a strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: <br>
Horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults.<br>
Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal,<br>
Can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four.<br>
They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years.<br>

Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods",<br> 
Such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and "warmbloods", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, <br>
Often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today,<br>
Developed for many different uses. Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits,<br>
As well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy. Horses were historically used in warfare, <br>
From which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and methods of control.<br>
Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares.<br>
Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water and shelter, as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers.<br>
