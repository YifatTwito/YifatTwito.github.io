<h1 style="text-align:center; color:blue">About Hippos</h1>
<p style= color:darkviolet> 
 Hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus amphibius) are large, round, water-loving animals that are native to Africa.<br>
 The word "hippopotamus" comes from the Greek word for "water horse" or "river horse,"<br>
 Although hippos and horses aren't closely related. The closest living relatives to hippos are pigs, <br>
 Whales and dolphins, according to the San Diego Zoo.<br>
</p>
 
    <h2 style="text-align:center; color:blue">Size</h2>
    <p style= color:darkviolet>
    Hippos are very rotund animals and are the third largest living land mammals, after elephants and white rhinos,<br> 
    According to Animal Planet. They grow to between 10.8 and 16.5 feet (3.3 to 5 meters) long and up to 5.2 feet (1.6 m) tall at the shoulder.<br>
    The average female weighs around 3,000 lbs. (1,400 kilograms), while males weigh 3,500 to 9,920 lbs. (1,600 to 4,500 kg),<br>
    According to the San Diego Zoo. 
</p> 
 
<h2 style="text-align:center; color:blue"> Habitat</h2>
<p style= color:darkviolet> 
    Hippos live in sub-Saharan Africa. They live in areas with abundant water, as they spend most of their time submerged <br>
    To keep their skin cool and moist. Considered amphibious animals, hippos spend up to 16 hours per day in the water, <br>
    According to National Geographic.<br>
        
    Hippos are social beasts, hanging out in groups called schools, bloats, pods or sieges.<br>
    Schools of hippos usually consist of 10 to 30 members, including both females and males, <br>
    Although some groups have as many as 200 individuals. No matter the size, the school is usually led by a dominant male.
